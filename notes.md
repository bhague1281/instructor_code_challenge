# Notes

## Backend

- Chose to use the ruby backend.

## To Do

- add some basic CSS/styling

- clean up code where possible (double-check naming, functions, etc.)

- run JS through JSLint, HTML through validator

- comments for beginners


---

**Bonus**

- Rewrite the application using a JavaScript MVC library. Include a readme that explains the benefits and any additional challenges students would face learning the library

## Summary

- For this project, I chose the ruby backend because I'm a little more familiar with ruby. Not familiar with Sinatra, but few problems were encountered, since it's pretty similar to Flask.
