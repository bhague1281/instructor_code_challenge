# Notes

## Backend

- Chose to use the ruby backend.

---

**Bonus**

- Rewrite the application using a JavaScript MVC library. Include a readme that explains the benefits and any additional challenges students would face learning the library

---

## Summary

- For this project, I chose the Ruby backend because I'm a little more familiar with Ruby. Not familiar with Sinatra, but few problems were encountered, since it's pretty similar to Flask.

- The app JavaScript is broken up into four main functions, representing these actions:
    * search for movies
    * add a movie to the favorites list
    * viewing the favorites list
    * showing a movie's details

### Backlog of Possible changes

- incorporate Bootstrap or other front-end framework instead of minimal CSS
- add more error checking, in case API returns inconsistent results
- add ability to remove favorites
