# Notes

## Backend

- Chose to use the ruby backend.

## To Do

- clean up code where possible (double-check naming, functions, etc.)

- HTML through validator

- comments for beginners


---

**Bonus**

- Rewrite the application using a JavaScript MVC library. Include a readme that explains the benefits and any additional challenges students would face learning the library

## Summary

- For this project, I chose the Ruby backend because I'm a little more familiar with Ruby. Not familiar with Sinatra, but few problems were encountered, since it's pretty similar to Flask.

- The app JavaScript is broken up into four main functions, representing these actions:
    * search for movies
    * add a movie to the favorites list
    * viewing the favorites list
    * showing a movie's details
